# Meteor map
This is a web application that shows meteor trajectories as measured by the [Global Meteor Network](https://globalmeteornetwork.org/) or [CAMS](http://cams.seti.org/). The data from the global meteor network can be loaded through the interface; for loading CAMS data you'll have to have a file called `SummaryMeteorLog.txt` or so. You can drag that file onto the map.
